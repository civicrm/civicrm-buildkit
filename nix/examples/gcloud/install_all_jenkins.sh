## This is an example of how to setup /etc/bknix-ci/install_all_jenkins.sh
## for an ephemeral/dev-oriented gcloud VM.
##
## It defines very high-level options for installing profiles for user "jenkins",
## changing defaults for `HTTPD_DOMAIN`, `PROFILES`, etc.

## This ramdisk is smaller than usual because we use pre-emptible instances that don't retain data as long.

## There is a startup script (via https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/startup-scripts/) which calls
## `reset-ci.sh` (shutdown+upgrade+start all services). "Enabling" services (auto-start via systemd) just adds
## noise and makes it hard to detect the final startup.
