## bknix: Build/test environments for civicrm-buildkit

`bknix` is a highly opinionated environment for developing in PHP/JS -- esp for developing patches/add-ons for CiviCRM.

For discussion of strengths and weaknesses, see [Critical comparison](doc/comparison.md).

## Profiles

A *profile* is list of packages (e.g. PHP 8.1 + MySQL 5.7 + Redis 4.0 + NodeJS 14.0).  `bknix` includes a few profiles designed around the
CiviCRM system-requirements:

* [dfl](profiles/dfl/default.nix): An in-between set of packages. This is a good default for middle-of-the-road testing/development.
* [min](profiles/min/default.nix): An older set of packages based on minimum system requirements.
* [max](profiles/max/default.nix): A newer set of packages based on maximum system requirements.
* [old](profiles/old/default.nix): An older set of packages for working with older versions of Civi (eg ESR versions and unsupported versions).
* [edge](profiles/edge/default.nix): A newer set of packages that exceeds our current official support; a proposal for the next `max`.

## Launchers

Given that you have several pieces of software (e.g. PHP + MySQL + Redis), the *launcher* or *process manager*
is responsible for starting and stopping processes. `bknix` works with a few launchers:

* `loco`: [Loco](https://github.com/totten/loco) runs local processes in the foreground (`loco run`) or background (`loco start`). This is useful for local development.
  It can be configured by editing the YAML file ([loco.yml](../.loco/loco.yml)), by setting environment variables
  (`HTTPD_PORT` et al), and/or by editing the [configuration templates](../.loco/config).
* `systemd`: This is the most common process manager on Linux hosts. This is useful for long-running nodes. The `loco.yml`
  can be exported to systemd notation manually (via `loco export`) or automatically (as part of `install-ci.sh`).

## Usage

For day-to-day usage, one must first launch the services (`mysqld`, `php-fpm`, etc). For example:

```
me@localhost:~$ cd bknix
me@localhost:~/bknix$ nix-shell -A min
[nix-shell:~/bknix]$ loco start
...
======================[ Startup Summary ]======================
[VOLUME] Loco data volume is a ram disk "/Users/myuser/bknix/.loco/var".
[redis] Redis is running on "127.0.0.1:6380".
[php-fpm] PHP-FPM is running on "127.0.0.1:9009"
[mailcatcher] Mailcatcher is running on "smtp://127.0.0.1:1025" and "http://127.0.0.1:1080"
[apache-vdr] Apache HTTPD is running at "http://127.0.0.1:8001" with content from "/Users/myuser/bknix/build".
[mysql] MySQL is running on "127.0.0.1:3307". The default credentials are user="root" and password="".
[buildkit] Buildkit (/Users/myuser/bknix/civicrm-buildkit) is configured to use these services. It produces builds in "/Users/myuser/bknix/build".

Services have been started. To shutdown, run 'loco stop'.
===============================================================

[nix-shell:~/bknix]$ civibuild create dmaster --civi-ver 5.8
...

[nix-shell:~/bknix]$ loco stop
```

In this example, note that:

* We chose the profile `min`. This determines the specific software and versions that will be available.
* We opened a suitable shell with `cd bknix` and `nix-shell -A min`.
* We started the services in background with `loco start`. (To run services in the foreground, use `loco run`.)
* After launching the services, we can create specific test-sites running on top of them.
* When we finish, stop the services with `loco stop`.

## Choose your own adventure

The example above used `nix-shell` and `loco start`. This is good for experimenting with bknix in the CLI. However,
if you're using an IDE or continuous-testing server, then other approaches may work better. For a more

## Ports

With `nix-shell` or `install-developer.sh`, it is typical to only launch one
"stack" of services. The services run on the following ports:

| Service     | Typical Port |
|-------------|--------------|
| Apache HTTP | 8001         |
| Memcached   | 12221        |
| MySQL       | 3307         |
| PHP FPM     | 9009         |
| PHP Xdebug  | 9000         |
| Redis       | 6380         |
| Mailcatcher (SMTP) (*loco-only*) | 1025  |
| Mailcatcher (HTTP) (*loco-only*) | 1080  |

With [`install-ci.sh`](doc/install-ci.md) or [`install-runner.sh`](doc/install-runner.md), the services use a wide range of ports.

<!-- FIXME: Document use of HTTPD_PORT, MYSQLD_PORT, etc -->

FIXME: rewrite this for master-loco branch

* A "build" is a collection of PHP/JS/CSS/etc source-code projects, with a database and an HTTP virtual host. You can edit/commit directly in the source-tree.
* All builds are stored in the `build` folder.
* All builds are given the URL `http://<name>.bknix:8001`. (Changeable)
* All hostnames are registered in `/etc/hosts` using `sudo`. (Changeable)
* All services run as the current, logged-in user. This means that files require no special permissions.
* MySQL launches on-demand with all-ram-disk-based storage. Launching is triggered on-demand (`civibuild create ...`) or by calling `amp mysql:start`
* PHP enables `xdebug`, which connects to a debugger UI on port 9000. (Changeable)

-->

Some of these policies/opinions can be changed, as described below ("Extended installation")

## Tips

(**Stale**: These tips should be rewritten to match the new "Quick Start" approach)

* To run Civi unit tests with xdebug in PHPStorm...
    * Lookup and register the PHP interpreter.
        * In CLI, run `nix-shell` and `which php`.
        * In PHPStorm, open "Preferences" and find list of PHP interpreters. Register this one.
    * Lookup and register the PATH.
        * In CLI, run `nix-shell` and `echo $PATH`.
        * In PHPStorm, open "Run => Edit Configurations". For the default PHPUnit, add an environment variable `PATH` with the given value.
        * If there are active PHPUnit configurations, update them or delete them (so they can be regenerated on-demand).
    * In the future -- whenever you upgrade the PHP runtime -- you may need to update these settings.
* If you don't already have `git` on your system, patch `default.nix` and add it to the list of `buildInputs`.
  However, if you already have it, then leave the default. (This would prevent potential concerns about different programs managing the same `.git` folders.)
* To open a MySQL command prompt with admin credentials, run `amp sql -a`.
* If you're doing development on the bknix service configuration, use `loco clean` or `loco run -f` (<s><code>bknix purge</code></s>) to produce a clean folder (without any data or config).
* When you shutdown, the mysql ramdisk remains in memory. To remove or reset it, unmount it with `umount` (in Linux) or *Disk Utility* (in OS X).

## Updates

(**Stale**: These update steps should be rewritten to match the new "Quick Start" approach)

There are a few levels of updates. They run a spectrum from regular (daily)
to irregular (once every months).

* (*Most frequent; perhaps every day*) *Update the CiviCRM source*: See [CiviCRM Developer Guide: civibuild](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/tools/civibuild/#upgrade-site)
* (*Mid-level; perhaps every couple weeks*) *Update buildkit's CLI tools*: Run `cd civicrm-buildkit && git pull && civi-download-tools`.
* (*Least frequent; perhaps every couple months*) *Update the full `bknix` stack (mysqld/httpd/etc)*: This takes a few steps.
    * If you haven't already, shutdown any active services (`Ctrl-C` in the terminal). Run `loco clean` to remove any service state.
    * Exit any active `nix-shell` environments.
    * `cd civicrm-buildkit && git pull`
    * Open a new `nix-shell` and start `loco run` again.
    * If you have an IDE configuration which references the PHP interpreter or PATH, update the IDE.
