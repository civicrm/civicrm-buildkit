# civicrm-buildkit

Buildkit is a collection of ~20 tools for developing and testing CiviCRM.
These tools are referenced in the CiviCRM developer documentation.

Many of these tools are commonly used by web developers, so you may have
already installed a few.  Even so, it's generally easier to download the
full collection -- installing each individually takes a lot of work.

This is the same collection of tools which manages the test/demo/release
infrastructure for civicrm.org.

## Requirements

 * Bash (Unix shell)
 * Git
 * PHP 5.3+ (For MAMP/XAMPP/etc, see [Setup Command-Line PHP](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Setup+Command-Line+PHP))
 * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
 * Recommended: Apache 2.2+ and MySQL 5.1+ (client and server) (for [amp](https://github.com/totten/amp) and [civibuild](doc/civibuild.md))
 * Recommended: Ruby/Rake (for [hub](http://hub.github.com/))

## Download: Option #1: Full Stack Ubuntu

If you have a new installation of Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04, then you can download
everything -- buildkit and the system requirements (`git`, `php`, `apache`, `mysql`, etc) -- with
one command. This command will install buildkit to `~/buildkit`:

```bash
curl -Ls https://civicrm.org/get-buildkit.sh | bash -s -- --full --dir ~/buildkit
```

Note:
 * When executing the above command, you should *not* run as root. However, you *should*
have `sudo` permissions.
 * The `--full` option is *opinionated*; it specifically installs `php`, `apache`, and `mysql` (rather than `hvm`, `nginx`, `lighttpd`, or `percona`). If you try to mix `--full` with alternative systems, then expect conflicts.

## Download: Option #2: Other Systems

If you already installed the requirements (`git`, `php` etc), then you can
download buildkit to `~/buildkit` with these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit.git ~/buildkit
cd ~/buildkit
./bin/civi-download-tools
```

## Download: Option #3: Upgrade

If you have previously downloaded buildkit and want to update it, run:

```bash
cd ~/buildkit
git pull
./bin/civi-download-tools
```

### CLI Setup: Option #1: Persistent

It is useful to register buildkit in the `PATH`. This enables you to run commands
by entering a name (e.g.  `civix`) rather than a full path (e.g.
`/path/to/buildkit/bin/civix`).

If you want to ensure that these CLI tools are always available, then:
 
 1. Determine the location of your shell configuration file. This is usually `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.profile`.
 2. At the end of the file, add `export PATH="/path/to/buildkit/bin:$PATH"` (*with proper adjustments to match your local system*).
 3. Close and reopen the terminal.
 4. Enter the command `which civibuild`. This should display a full-path. If nothing appears, then retry the steps.

### CLI Setup: Option #2: Temporary

Alternatively, if you're just getting started, or if you worry about
conflicts between buildkit and your existing tools, then you can
register buildkit in the PATH temporarily. Simply adapt and run the `export`
command directly in the terminal:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/buildkit/bin:$PATH
```

You can restore the normal environment by closing the terminal and opening
a new one.

Each time you open a new terminal while working on Civi development, you
would need to re-run the `export` command.

### CLI Setup: Composer

If you want to set up buildkit using composer, do the following...

* Add the following to ~/.composer/composer.json
  
  ```
  {
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "repositories": [
      {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit.git"
      },
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/civicrm/coder.git"
      },
      {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/totten/paratest.git"
      },
      {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/totten/joomla-console.git"
      }
    ],
    "require": {
      "civicrm/civicrm-buildkit": "dev-master"
    }
  }
  ```
  
* Run `composer global update`
* Add `~/.composer/vendor/bin` to your PATH varariable like so:
  `export PATH=$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH`

You will now have the ability to run civibuild, civilint, etc, globally.
