# civicrm-buildkit

Buildkit is a collection of ~20 tools for developing and testing CiviCRM.
These tools are referenced in the CiviCRM developer documentation.

Many of these tools are commonly used by web developers, so you may have
already installed a few.  Even so, it's generally easier to download the
full collection -- installing each individually takes a lot of work.

This is the same collection of tools which manages the test/demo/release
infrastructure for civicrm.org.

## Requirements

 * Bash (Unix shell)
 * Git
 * PHP 5.3+ (For MAMP/XAMPP/etc, see [Setup Command-Line PHP](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Setup+Command-Line+PHP))
 * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
 * Recommended: Apache 2.2+ and MySQL 5.1+ (client and server) (for [amp](https://github.com/totten/amp) and [civibuild](doc/civibuild.md))
 * Recommended: Ruby/Rake (for [hub](http://hub.github.com/))

## Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit.git buildkit
cd buildkit
./bin/civi-download-tools
```

## Upgrade

```bash
cd buildkit
git pull
./bin/civi-download-tools
```

### CLI Setup: Persistent

It is useful to register buildkit in the PATH. This enables you to run commands
by entering a name (e.g.  "civix") rather than a full path (e.g.
"/path/to/buildkit/bin/civix").

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/buildkit/bin:$PATH
```

If you want to ensure that these CLI tools are always available, then edit
~/.bashrc or ~/.profile, add buildkit to your PATH, and restart the
terminal.

### CLI Setup: Temporary

Alternatively, if you're just getting started, or if you worry about
conflicts between buildkit and your existing tools, then you can
register buildkit in the PATH temporarily. Simply run the ***export***
command directly in the terminal -- do not edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile.

You can restore the normal environment by closing the terminal and opening
a new one.

Each time you open a new terminal while working on Civi development, you
would need to re-run ***export***.

### CLI Setup: Composer

If you want to set up buildkit using composer, do the following...

* Add the following to ~/.composer/composer.json
  
  ```
  {
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "repositories": [
      {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit.git"
      },
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/civicrm/coder.git"
      },
      {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/totten/paratest.git"
      },
      {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/totten/joomla-console.git"
      }
    ],
    "require": {
      "civicrm/civicrm-buildkit": "dev-master"
    }
  }
  ```
  
* Run `composer global update`
* Add `~/.composer/vendor/bin` to your PATH varariable like so:
  `export PATH=$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH`

You will now have the ability to run civibuild, civilint, etc, globally.
